South American sea lion telemetry data

The files contain GPS tracking data and haulout records for South American sea lions in northern Chile in 2011. 
Sea lions were fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit Satellite Relay Data Logger (SRDL) units which transmitted data via the Argos satellite system.

Please contact Bethany Frantz bntyhf@gmail.com if you plan on using these data.
